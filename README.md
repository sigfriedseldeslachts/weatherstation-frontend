# Weather Station Frontend

This is the frontend view of my custom weather station. It's a Nuxt.js application using server side rendering.

## Backend

The backend is located at [github.com/sigfriedseldeslachts/weatherstation-backend](https://github.com/sigfriedseldeslachts/weatherstation-backend).

## Build Setup

Here are some simple instructions. You can find a detailed explanation on the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
